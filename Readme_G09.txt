To compile the project, please ensure that the gcc or cc compiler is configured to support the C99 standard. Start the program by typing “./SPMS” and a welcome message will be shown on the screen. If you wish to import a batch file for one or more requests, please upload the file as a plain text document (.dat) to apollo in the same directory.

Note that for the booking requests in addBatch, there should not be a hyphen "-" before member_X, a space " " instead of semicolon ";" to end each booking request.
Here is an example below (between the ""):

"addReservation member_A 2025-05-20 14:00 3.0 battery cable "

To end the program, type "endProgram" in the terminal.
